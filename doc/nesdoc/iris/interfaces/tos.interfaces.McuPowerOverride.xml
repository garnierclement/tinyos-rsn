          <long>
 Called when computing the low power state, in order to allow
 a high-level component to institute a lower bound. Because
 this command originates deep within the basic TinyOS scheduling
 mechanisms, it should be used very sparingly. Refer to TEP 112 for
 details.

 @return    the lowest power state the system can enter to meet the 
            requirements of this component
