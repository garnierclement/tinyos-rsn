    <h2>Interface: tos.lib.rfxlink.util.Tasklet</h2>
    <b>interface Tasklet</b><p>
 This interface is useful in building state machines when the state 
 transitions should be executed atomically but with interrupts enabled. 
 All state transitions should take place in the run event handler or
 in blocks protected by the suspend and resume commands.

    <p><p><div id=heading>Commands</div><div id=funcsig><span id=funcnameshort>command void <a href="#resume">resume</a>()
      </span><menu>
 Leaves the critical section.
      </menu>
    </div><div id=funcsig><span id=funcnameshort>command void <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>()
      </span><menu>
 Makes sure that the run event is called at least once more.
      </menu>
    </div><div id=funcsig><span id=funcnameshort>command void <a href="#suspend">suspend</a>()
      </span><menu>
 Enters a critical section of the code and meakes sure that the
 run event is not called while in this section.
      </menu>
    </div><p><div id=heading>Events</div><div id=funcsig><span id=funcnameshort>event void <a href="#run">run</a>()
      </span><menu>
 This method is executed atomically.
      </menu>
    </div><p><div id=heading>Commands - Details</div>
    <a name="resume"></a>
    <h4>resume
    </h4>
    <span id=funcnameshort>command void <b>resume</b>()
    </span>
    <p>
    <menu>
      
 Leaves the critical section. This call is conly possible from 
 task context. If there were scheduled executions of the run
 event, then those will be called before this command returns.

    </menu>
    <hr>
    <a name="schedule"></a>
    <h4>schedule
    </h4>
    <span id=funcnameshort>command void <b>schedule</b>()
    </span>
    <p>
    <menu>
      
 Makes sure that the run event is called at least once more. If the 
 run event is currently not executing, then it  is called immediately 
 and this command returns only after the completion of the run event. 
 If the run event is currently executed, then this method returns at 
 once, and makes sure that the run event is called once more when 
 it is finished. If this method is called from a task, then by the 
 above rules, the run event will be called from a task as well.

    </menu>
    <hr>
    <a name="suspend"></a>
    <h4>suspend
    </h4>
    <span id=funcnameshort>command void <b>suspend</b>()
    </span>
    <p>
    <menu>
      
 Enters a critical section of the code and meakes sure that the
 run event is not called while in this section. No long running
 computation should be called from the critical session, and
 in particular no user event should be fired. This call is only
 possible from task context, otherwise we cannot guarantee that
 the run event is not currently running. The suspend calls
 can be nested. It is very important that the same number of
 resume commands must be called in all control paths, e.g. be very
 careful with the return and break commands.

    </menu>
    <p><div id=heading>Events - Details</div>
    <a name="run"></a>
    <h4>run
    </h4>
    <span id=funcnameshort>event void <b>run</b>()
    </span>
    <p>
    <menu>
      
 This method is executed atomically.
