 This event is fired when the header is received/downloaded and the 
 higher layers are consulted whether it needs to be downloaded and 
 further processed. Return FALSE if the message should be discarded.
 In particular, the message buffer layer returns FALSE if there is
 no space for a new message, so this message will not get acknowledged.
